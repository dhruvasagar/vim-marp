# VIM Marp v0.2

A simple presentation tool to present marp files from within vim

## Installation

Choose your preferred method of installation

## Getting Started

Open the marp markdown file and invoke `:MarpStart`, this starts the marp
presentation session. It will close all existing windows / tabs and save that
in a temporary session and open a new buffer to display the presentation page
content to remove distractions. Once your presentation is done, you can invoke
`:MarpStop` to end the presentation, this will restore your session as it was
before you started your presentation.

Alternatively you can also start presentation view with the |:MarpFileStart|
command giving the marp file as an input.
